# Wind-Speed-Prediction
Analyzing different statistical and deep learning models for Time Series Data.

Usually Time Series have a dynamic pattern in them that needs to be analysed properly before making predictions.It may contain rythms, seasonality, trends, cyclicity and evolving behaviour that needs to be studied and understood.

Stationarity
Inorder to build a prediction model, our data needs to be stationary. If not we must make it stationary by carrying out methods such as detrending, differentiating etc(Check the stationarity.ipynb). Since our data is stationary,we may start building prediction models.
